This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

## Pre-Lab preparation

1. Use schematic of the [LCD keypad shield](https://oshwlab.com/tomas.fryza/arduino-shields) and find out the connection of LCD display. What data and control signals are used? What is the meaning of these signals?

   | **LCD signal(s)** | **AVR pin(s)** | **Description** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-- |
   | RS | PB0 | Register selection signal. Selection between Instruction register (RS=0) and Data register (RS=1) |
   | R/W | GND | Identifies read or write operation |
   | E | PB1 | A trigger signal whose edge synchronizes the communication on
the bus |
   | D[3:0] | - | Pins for 8-bit communication |
   | D[7:4] |PD[14:11]  | Pins for 4-bit communication |
   | K |  PB2 | Back light cathode |


1. Use the online manual of LCD library (generated by [Doxygen tool](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html#specialblock)) and add the input parameters and description of the following functions.

   | **Function name** | **Function parameters** | **Description** | **Example** |
   | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
   | `lcd_init` | `LCD_DISP_OFF`<br>`LCD_DISP_ON`<br>`LCD_DISP_ON_CURSOR`<br>`LCD_DISP_ON_CURSOR_BLINK` | Display off| `lcd_init(LCD_DISP_OFF);`<br>...&nbsp;<br>...&nbsp;<br>...&nbsp; |
   | `lcd_clrscr` | void |Clear display and set cursor to home position | `lcd_clrscr();` |
   | `lcd_gotoxy` |x -horizontal position<br>y -vertical position | Set cursor to specified position | lcd_gotoxy(417) |
   | `lcd_putc` | c	character to be displayed
 | Display character at current cursor position. | lcd_puyc('a') |
   | `lcd_puts` | s	string to be displayed
  Display string without auto linefeed |lcd_puts("digital")|
   | `lcd_command` | cmd	instruction to send to LCD controller, see HD44780 data sheet
 | Send LCD controller instruction command. | lcd_command(LCD_CLR)|
   | `lcd_data` | data	byte to send to LCD controller, see HD44780 data sheet
 | Send data byte to LCD controller. | lcd_data(0x0a) |





# Lab 4: Bratfalean Dragos

### Stopwatch

1. Draw a flowchart for `TIMER2_OVF_vect` interrupt service routine which overflows every 16&nbsp;ms but it updates the stopwatch LCD screen approximately every 100&nbsp;ms (6 x 16&nbsp;ms = 100&nbsp;ms). Display tenths of a second, seconds, and minutes and let the stopwatch counts from `00:00.0` to `59:59.9` and then starts again. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Use clear descriptions of the individual steps of the algorithms.

### Kitchen alarm

2. Draw a schema of the kitchen alarm application that counts down the time with an LCD, one LED and three push buttons: start, +1 minute, -1 minute. Use the +1/-1 minute buttons to increment/decrement the timer value. After pressing the Start button, the countdown starts. The countdown value is shown on the display in the form of mm.ss (minutes.seconds). At the end of the countdown, the LED will start blinking. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values.
